## Layout Search
This was the first part of the project
finding a carver seed that produces a mineshaft layout that has the potential of having x amount of chests in a column.
we also added trial chamber layout later on 


## Results
initial results wich looked for 7+ chest stack (the test run has alot of overlap with the actual run)
-> StackedMineshaftChestsVastAiRun(Test).txt

all results with 8+ stack (which we first used)
-> StackedMineshaftChests8Plus.txt

all results with 7+ stack and a good trial chamber layout (which we ended up using)
-> StackedMineshaftGoodTrialChamberLayout.txt
